## Dashboard Page

![Dashboard Page](Dashboard.png)


I chose a random dashboard design from dribbble, and I coded it using HTML and CSS(Flexbox and Grid).
Then, I told it how this project is done on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M73bzz9Xq0s&list=PL6SDWesoLYTVtrsL4C5u-HBm76_e75bpb) in Turkish. Thank you in advance for listening.
